abstract: "Biometric-based remote user authentication is a useful primitive that allows an authorized user to authenticate to a remote server using his biometrics. Leakage attacks, such as side-channel attacks, allow an attacker to learn partial knowledge of secrets (e.g., biometrics) stored on any physical medium. Leakage attacks can be potentially launched to any existing biometric-based remote user authentication systems. Furthermore, applying plain biometrics is an efficient and straightforward approach when designing remote user authentication schemes. However, this approach jeopardises userâ€™s biometrics privacy. To address these issues, we propose a novel leakage-resilient and privacy-preserving biometric-based remote user authentication framework, such that registered users securely and privately authenticate to an honest-but-curious remote server in the cloud. In particular, the proposed generic framework provides optimal efficiency using lightweight symmetric-key cryptography, and it remains secure under leakage attacks. We formalize several new security models, including leakage-resilient user authenticity and leakage-resilient biometrics privacy, for biometric-based remote user authentication, and prove the security of proposed framework under standard assumptions."
