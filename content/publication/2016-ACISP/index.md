abstract: "<p>Oblivious Signature-Based Envelope (OSBE) has been
widely employed for anonymity-orient and privacy-preserving applications.
The conventional OSBE execution relies on a secure communication
channel to protect against eavesdroppers. In TCC 2012, Blazy,
Pointcheval and Vergnaud proposed a framework of OSBE (BPV-OSBE)
without requiring any secure channel by clarifying and enhancing the
OSBE security notions. They showed how to generically build an OSBE
scheme satisfying the new strong security in the standard model with
a common-reference string. Their framework requires 2-round interactions
and relies on the smooth projective hash function (SPHF) over
special languages, i.e., languages from encryption of signatures. In this
work, we investigate the study on the strong OSBE and make the following
contributions. First, we propose a generic construction of one-round
yet strong OSBE system. Compared to the 2-round BPV-OSBE, our
one-round construction is more appealing, as its non-interactive setting
accommodates more application scenarios in the real word. Moreover,
our framework relies on the regular (identity-based) SPHF, which can
be instantiated from extensive languages and hence is more general. Second,
we also present an efficient instantiation, which is secure under the
standard model from classical assumptions, DDH and DBDH, to illustrate
the feasibility of our one-round framework. We remark that our
construction is the first one-round OSBE with strong security.</p>"
