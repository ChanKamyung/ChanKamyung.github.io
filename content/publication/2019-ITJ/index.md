abstract: "Nowadays, outsourcing data and machine learning tasks, e.g., k􀀀nearest neighbour (KNN) classification, to clouds has
become a scalable and cost-effective way for large scale data storage, management, and processing. However, data security and
privacy issue has been a serious concern in outsourcing data to clouds. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving KNN
classification scheme on cloud data in a twin-cloud model based on an additively homomorphic cryptosystem and secret sharing.
Compared with existing works, we redesign a set of lightweight building blocks, such as secure square Euclidean distance, secure
comparison, secure sorting, secure minimum and maximum number finding and secure frequency calculating, which achieve the same
security level but with higher efficiency. In our scheme, data owners stay off-line, which is different from secure-multiparty computation
based solutions which require data owners’ stay on-line during computation. In addition, query users do not interact with the cloud
except sending query data and receiving the query results. Our security analysis shows that the scheme protects outsourced data
security and query privacy, and hides access patterns. Experiments on real-world dataset indicate that our scheme is significantly more
efficient than existing schemes."
