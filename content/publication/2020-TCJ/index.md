abstract: "Subversion of cryptography has received wide attentions especially after the Snowden Revelations
in 2013. Most of the currently proposed subversion attacks essentially rely on the freedom of randomness
choosing in the cryptographic protocol to hide backdoors embedded in the cryptosystems.
Despite the fact that significant progresses in this line of research have been made, most of them
mainly considered the classical setting, while the research gap regarding subversion attacks against
post-quantum cryptography remains tremendous. Inspired by this observation, we investigate a
subversion attack against existing protocol that is proved post-quantum secure. Particularly, we
show an efficient way to undetectably subvert the well-known lattice-based encryption scheme
proposed by Regev (STOC 2005). Our subversion enables the subverted algorithm to stealthily
leak arbitrary messages to the outsider who knows the backdoor. Through theoretical analysis and
experimental observations, we demonstrate that the subversion attack against the LWE encryption
scheme is feasible and practical."
