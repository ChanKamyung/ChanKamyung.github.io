abstract: "<p>Traditionally, a ciphertext from an identity-based broadcast
encryption can be distributed to a group of receivers whose identities
are included in the ciphertext. Once the ciphertext has been created, it
is not possible to remove any intended receivers from it without conducting
decryption. In this paper, we consider an interesting question:
<i>how to remove target designated receivers from a ciphertext generated
by an anonymous identity-based broadcast encryption?</i> The solution to
this question is found applicable to file sharing with revocation. In this
work, we found an affirmative answer to this question. We construct an
anonymous identity-based broadcast encryption, which offers the user
revocation of ciphertext and the revocation process does not reveal any
information of the plaintext and receiver identity. In our proposed
scheme, the group of receiver identities are anonymous and only known
by the encryptor. We prove that our scheme is semantically secure in the
random oracle model.</p>"
