abstract: "<p>Data sharing and searching are important functionalities in cloud storage. In this paper, we show how to securely and flexibly search and share cloud data among a group of users without a group manager. We formalize a novel cryptosystem: secure channel free searchable encryption in a peer-to-peer group, which features with the secure cloud data sharing and searching for group members in an identity-based setting. Our scheme allows group members to join or leave the group dynamically. We present two schemes: basic scheme and enhanced scheme. We formally prove that our basic scheme achieves consistency and indistinguishability against the chosen keyword and ciphertext attack and the outsiderâ€™s keyword guessing attack, respectively. An enhanced scheme is also proposed to achieve forward secrecy, which allows to revoke user search right over the former shared data.</p>"
