abstract: "Studies of subversion attack against cryptosystem could be dated to several decades ago, while the Snowden revelation
in 2013 has set off a new wave of exploring possible approaches to protect or subvert cryptography primitives in practice.
Inspired by kleptographic attacks proposed by Young et al. [Crypto’96], we present the asymmetric subversion attack on
signature and identification schemes in this work. Our contributions is summarized as follows:
<ul>
<li> We present the asymmetric subversion model for signature and identification schemes. The properties of our model are
stronger than that of existing subversion model proposed by Giuseppe et al. [CCS’15] and show higher requirement in
attack goal.</li>
<li> We propose the notion of splittable signature scheme and give a universal asymmetric subversion attack on such
schemes. Our attack is independent of secret key size and more efficient than symmetric attacks introduced by Giuseppe
et al. [CCS’15].</li>
<li> We introduce the asymmetric subversion attack on a special type of identification schemes and show that it can be
transformed from splittable signature scheme.</li>
</ul>Our subversion attack is demonstrated to be practical and could be mounted on many common schemes, which shows the
danger of subversion attacks and spurs the exploring of effective deterrents."
