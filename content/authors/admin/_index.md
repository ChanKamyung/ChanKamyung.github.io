**Rongmao Chen** got the Ph.D. in cryptography from [University of Wollongong](http://www.uow.edu.au/), Australia in 2016. Before that, he received the B.Eng (2011) and M.Eng (2013) in computer science from [National University of Defense Technology](http://english.nudt.edu.cn/index_eng.htm), China. 

He is interested in designing secure cryptographic protocols against real-world attacks (e.g., typical attacks, leakage attacks and subversion attacks), and applying cryptographic techniques to protect data security and user privacy against the (possibly) untrusted cloud service and compromised computer network.

He was a visiting researcher at [COSIC](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/) in KU Leuven, Belgium from 2019.03 to 2020.03. His host was [Prof. Bart Preneel](https://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~preneel/).
