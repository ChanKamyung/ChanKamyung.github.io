Practically implementable ASAs on various cryptographic primitives (Bellare et al., CRYPTO’14 \u0026 ACM CCS’15; Ateniese et al., ACM CCS’15; Berndt and Liśkiewicz, ACM CCS’17) have been constructed and analyzed, leaking the secret key successfully. Nevertheless, in spite of much progress, the practical impact of ASAs (formulated originally for symmetric key cryptography) on public-key (PKE) encryption operations remains unclear, primarily since the encryption operation of PKE does not involve the secret key, and also previously known ASAs become relatively inefficient for leaking the plaintext due to the logarithmic upper bound of exfiltration rate (Berndt and Liśkiewicz, ACM CCS’17).\nIn this work, we formulate a practical ASA on PKE encryption algorithm which, perhaps surprisingly, turns out to be much more efficient and robust than existing ones, showing that ASAs on PKE schemes are far more effective and dangerous than previously believed. We mainly target PKE of hybrid encryption which is the most prevalent way to employ PKE in the literature and in practice. The main strategy of our ASA is to subvert the underlying key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) so that the session key encapsulated could be efficiently extracted, which, in turn, breaks the data encapsulation mechanism (DEM) enabling us to learn the plaintext itself. Concretely, our non-black-box yet quite general attack enables recovering the plaintext from only two successive ciphertexts and minimally depends on a short state of previous internal randomness. A widely used class of KEMs is shown to be subvertible by our powerful attack.\nOur attack relies on a novel identification and formalization of certain properties that yield practical ASAs on KEMs. More broadly, it points at and may shed some light on exploring structural weaknesses of other “composed cryptographic primitives,” which may make them susceptible to more dangerous ASAs with effectiveness that surpasses the known logarithmic upper bound (i.e., reviewing composition as an attack enabler).\n","tags":["Subversion-Resilient Cryptography"],"title":"Subvert KEM to Break DEM: Practical Algorithm-Substitution Attacks on Public-Key Encryption","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yusheng Xia","Rongmao Chen","Jinshu Su","Hongcheng Zou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605139200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605139200,"objectID":"d1adbb86106b3f543610b1c5d3ab089f","permalink":"https://chankamyung.github.io/publication/2020-cs/","publishdate":"2020-11-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-cs/","section":"publication","summary":"Anonymous communication networks (ACNs) are intended to protect the metadata privacy during the communication.

However, this is usually undesirable for network service providers because attackers would be able to anonymize themselves and avoid regulation while conducting network attacks. Therefore, network service providers want to hold users accountable and it has been widely considered as a tussle to find a good balance point between the accountability and privacy for the Internet. In this work, we first show that existing representative approaches mainly suffer from narrow-range accountability, low efficiency or risky key management. Motivated by these observations, we propose an efficient network layer protocol called APGS to balance the accountability and privacy. At the core of our APGS is the group signature which, however, is not trivial to apply for the network layer mainly due to the efficiency, revocation, and privacy issues. We manage to overcome these challenges via proposing some novel approaches, including challenge-based cache strategy, scalable verifier-local revocation strategy, and Onion-then-Case strategy. We then evaluate the efficiency of APGS and conclude that in our environment, APGS can generate packets up to 20k pkts/s on a desktop and achieve approximately 80% of IP's goodput at most on a software router.\n","tags":["Cryptographic Protocols for Privacy-Oriented Applications"],"title":"APGS: An Efficient Source-Accountable and Metadata-Private Protocol in the Network Layer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xueqiao Liu","Guomin Yang","Willy Susilo","Joseph Tonien","Rongmao Chen","Xixiang Lv"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1593648000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593648000,"objectID":"36fa0934afa1b91d3d7a6609f0a9a83a","permalink":"https://chankamyung.github.io/publication/2020-tsc/","publishdate":"2020-07-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-tsc/","section":"publication","summary":"Message-Locked Encryption (MLE) is a useful tool to enable deduplication over encrypted data in cloud storage.

A typical MLE scheme only focuses on deduplication. On the other hand, supporting search operations on stored content is another essential requirement for cloud storage. In this paper, we present a message-locked searchable encryption (MLSE) scheme in a dual-server setting, which achieves simultaneously the desirable features of supporting deduplication and enabling users to perform search operations over encrypted data. In addition, it supports both multi-keyword and negative keyword searches. We formulate the security notions of MLSE and prove our scheme satisfies all the security requirements.

Specifically, none of the existing works have considered the client’s control over changes in storage duration. In this paper, we propose an RDIC scheme to simultaneously check the data content and storage duration represented by an updatable timestamp via the third-party auditor (TPA). Also, our proposed scheme achieves indistinguishable privacy (IND-privacy) against TPA for both data content and timestamp. To bind the content and timestamp in the authenticator and support efficient timestamp update, we construct the authenticator with the randomizable structure-preserving signature (SPS). Additionally, we utilize the Groth-Sahai proof and range proof to provide the IND-privacy and guarantee the timestamp validation in the auditing phase. We formalize the definition and security model and provide the formal proof of our scheme.

However, the issue of data privacy is far from being well solved and thus has been a general concern in the cloud-aided machine learning. In this work, we investigate the study of how to efficiently do decision tree training and evaluation in the cloud and meanwhile achieve privacy preservation. Unlike existing cloud server-assisted model training approaches, in our proposed solution, the whole training process is mostly done by the cloud service provider who owns the machine learning model. Since the cloud cannot directly divide the encrypted dataset according to the best attributes selected, we propose a new method for decision tree training without dataset splitting. Precisely, we design three methods for decision tree training with the different tradeoff between privacy and efficiency. In all of these methods, the outsourced data are not revealed to the cloud service provider. We also propose a privacy-preserving decision tree evaluation scheme where the cloud service provider learns nothing about the user’s input and the classification result while the trained model is kept secret to the user who could only learn the classification result. Compared with previous decision tree evaluation work, our scheme achieves desirable privacy preservation against both the user and the cloud service provider, and also minimizes the user’s computation and communication costs. Moreover, besides protecting the data confidentiality, our proposed scheme also supports off-line users and thus has good scalability. The realworld dataset-based experimental results demonstrate that our system is of desirable utility and efficiency.","tags":["Cryptographic Protocols for Privacy-Oriented Applications"],"title":"Towards Practical Privacy-Preserving Decision Tree Training and Evaluation in the Cloud","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jie Li","Rongmao Chen","Jinshu Su","Xinyi Huang","Xiaofeng Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573776000,"objectID":"806fbafe1c01375c64b8b9074b69bd90","permalink":"https://chankamyung.github.io/publication/2020-itj/","publishdate":"2019-11-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-itj/","section":"publication","summary":"In-network middleboxes are vital for Internet-of-things system security, but the widely adopted Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol blinds application-level middleboxes due to the encryption of traffic data. To resolve this problem, many solutions have been proposed to date. Among them, SplitTLS is widely adopted in the industry by proxy manufacturers. It requires TLS client to install customized root certificates and incurs additional security flaws, e.g., disabling server authentication and using weak cipher suites. Another approach is to customize the TLS protocol where middleboxes are enabled via either performing handshake directly with TLS endpoints, or receiving session key materials in an out-of-band manner. Overall, current solutions would either jeopardize the original TLS handshake procedure, or incur additional overheads on the endpoints. In this paper we design a new middlebox-enhanced TLS (ME-TLS), which enables endpoints to introduce authenticated middleboxes into a TLS session while control middleboxes’ access permission and processing order of traffic data. Particularly, in our proposed ME-TLS, the handshake structure of TLS keeps unchanged and middleboxes work in a passive manner. That is, middleboxes in the ME-TLS could recover session key materials by monitoring handshake messages passively instead of interacting with endpoints, secondary secure channels for key transmission are also not needed in our ME-TLS. We implement our ME-TLS based on TLS 1.3 protocol and evaluate its performances. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposal is practical and deployable for real-world IoT scenarios.","tags":["Cryptographic Protocols for Privacy-Oriented Applications"],"title":"ME-TLS: Middlebox-Enhanced TLS for Internet-of-things Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhichao Yang","Rongmao Chen","Chao Li","Longjiang Qu","Guomin Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1568073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568073600,"objectID":"f450b122bbb7591dc4391c66e0481d25","permalink":"https://chankamyung.github.io/publication/2020-tcj/","publishdate":"2019-09-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-tcj/","section":"publication","summary":"Subversion of cryptography has received wide attentions especially after the Snowden Revelations in 2013. Most of the currently proposed subversion attacks essentially rely on the freedom of randomness choosing in the cryptographic protocol to hide backdoors embedded in the cryptosystems. Despite the fact that significant progresses in this line of research have been made, most of them mainly considered the classical setting, while the research gap regarding subversion attacks against post-quantum cryptography remains tremendous. Inspired by this observation, we investigate a subversion attack against existing protocol that is proved post-quantum secure.

However, it has been demonstrated that many standardized AKE protocols are vulnerable to side-channel and key leakage attacks. In order to defend against such attacks, leakage resilient (LR-) AKE protocols have been proposed in the literature. Nevertheless, most of the existing LR-AKE protocols only focused on the resistance to long-term key leakage, while in reality leakage of ephemeral secret key (or randomness) can also occur due to various reasons such as the use of poor randomness sources or insecure pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). In this paper, we revisit the strongly leakage resilient AKE protocol (CT-RSA’16) that aimed to resist challenge-dependent leakage on both long-term and ephemeral secret keys. We show that there is a security issue in the design of the protocol and propose an improved version that can fix the problem.

IBRS can be classified into unbounded IBRS and bounded IBRS, depending on whether to set a maximal revocation number (e.g., N) or not. Compared to unbounded IBRS, existing bounded IBRS schemes have the advantage of short ciphertexts, however, they cannot support an increase of N and have to fix a large N to provide the revocation. This compromises the computational efficiency, which is linear in N. To bridge this gap, we are interested in exploring whether N can be dynamic. Precisely, N is initially set as a small number and increased into a larger one when more than N identities are revoked, while this increase does not affect other non-revoked users in the system. In this paper, motivated by the security of bounded IBRS with a dynamic N, we define an enhanced security model, which allows the corruption of any polynomial number (e.g., n) of private keys, independent of N. It augments existing security models by running different challenges when n ≤ N and n  N, respectively. The enhanced security model suits both unbounded IBRS and bounded IBRS with a general description that can be “empty” for unbounded IBRS or a special N for bounded IBRS. Then, we propose a scalable bounded IBRS scheme and are able to prove its security in an enhanced security model. The increase of N incurs no changing on all of the existing private keys and the only cost is a slight expansion of the master public keys.

PKC 2012 \u0026 Bader et al. Eurocrypt 2016) have been well studied in the literature. Particularly, it has been shown that under a non-interactive hard assumption, any security reduction (with or without random oracles) for a unique signature scheme or an efficiently re-randomizable signature scheme must loose a factor of at least $q_s$ in the security model of existential unforgeability against chosen-message attacks (EU-CMA), where $q_s$ denotes the number of signature queries. Note that the number $q_s$ can be as large as $2^{30}$ in practice. All unique signature schemes and efficiently re-randomizable signature schemes are concluded to be accompanied with loose reductions from these impossibility results.\nSomewhat surprisingly, in contrast to previous impossibility results (Coron, Eurocrypt 2002; Hofheinz et al. PKC 2012; Bader et al. Eurocrypt 2016), in this work we show that without changing the assumption type and security model, it is not always the case that any security reduction must loose a factor of at least $q_s$. As a counterexample, we propose a unique signature scheme with a tight reduction in the EU-CMA security model under the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption. Precisely, in the random oracle model, we can program a security reduction with a loss factor of at most $nq^{1/n}$, where n can be any integer independent of the security parameter for the scheme construction and $q$ is the number of hash queries to random oracles. The loss factor in our reduction can be very small. Considering $n=25$ and $q=2^{50}$ as an example, the loss factor is of at most $nq^{1/n}=100$ and therefore our security reduction is tight.\nNotice that the previous impossibility results are derived from proofs via a so-called meta-reduction technique. We stress that instead of indicating any flaw in their meta-reduction proofs, our counterexample merely demonstrates that their given meta-reduction proofs fail to capture all security reductions. More precisely, we adopt a reduction called query-based reduction, where the reduction uses a hash query from the adversary to solve an underlying hard problem. We show that the meta-reduction proofs break down in our query-based reduction. The query-based reduction is not a new notion and it has been adopted for encryption proofs, but this work is the first seminal approach for applying query-based reduction in digital signatures.\nThe given counterexample in this work is of an independent interest as it implies a generic way of constructing a digital signature scheme (including unique signatures) with a tight reduction in the random oracle model from a digital signature scheme with a loose reduction. Although our proposed methodology is somewhat impractical due to the inefficiency of signature length, it introduces a completely new approach for tight proofs that is different from traditional approaches using a random salt.\n","tags":["Provable-Security Cryptography"],"title":"Optimal Security Reductions for Unique Signatures: Bypassing Impossibilities with a Counterexample","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jianchang Lai","Yi Mu","Fuchun Guo","Rongmao Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1496793600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1496793600,"objectID":"0244290ebec32f4c4f4a87824810269b","permalink":"https://chankamyung.github.io/publication/2017-tcj/","publishdate":"2017-06-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-tcj/","section":"publication","summary":"A revocable ID-based broadcast encryption scheme allows an authorized third party to revoke any receiver (decryptor) from the initial receiver set S of the original broadcast ciphertext without the need of decryption.

To solve these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel scheme: fully privacy-preserving ID-based broadcast encryption with authorization. Our scheme allows an authorized party to dynamically handle the decryption rights of receivers via an authorized user set L without knowing the message and the identities of the initial receivers. Only those users who are both in S and L can decrypt the ciphertext successfully. The final ciphertext reveals nothing about the identity information of receivers and the authorized users.

In Eurocrypt 2015, Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz proposed a novel concept named cryptographic reverse firewall (CRF) which can resist exfiltration of secret information from an arbitrarily compromised machine. In this work, we continue this line of research and present generic CRF constructions for several widely used cryptographic protocols based on a new notion named malleable smooth projective hash function. Our contributions can be summarized as follows.  We introduce the notion of malleable smooth projective hash function, which is an extension of the smooth projective hash function (SPHF) introduced by Cramer and Shoup (Eurocrypt’02) with the new properties of key malleability and element rerandomizability. We demonstrate the feasibility of our new notion using graded rings proposed by Benhamouda et al. (Crypto’13), and present an instantiation from the k-linear assumption.  We show how to generically construct CRFs via malleable SPHFs in a modular way for some widely used cryptographic protocols. Specifically, we propose generic constructions of CRFs for the unkeyed message-transmission protocol and the oblivious signature-based envelope (OSBE) protocol of Blazy, Pointcheval and Vergnaud (TCC’12). We also present a new malleable SPHF from the linear encryption of valid signatures for instantiating the OSBE protocol with CRFs.  We further study the two-pass oblivious transfer (OT) protocol and show that the malleable SPHF does not suffice for its CRF constructions. We then develop a new OT framework from graded rings and show how to construct OT-CRFs by modifying the malleable SPHF framework. This new framework encompasses the DDH-based OT-CRF constructions proposed by Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz (Eurocrypt’ 15), and yields a new construction under the k-linear assumption.","tags":["Subversion-Resilient Cryptography"],"title":"Cryptographic Reverse Firewall via Malleable Smooth Projective Hash Functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fuchun Guo","Willy Susilo","Yi Mu","Rongmao Chen","Jianchang Lai","Guomin Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480809600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480809600,"objectID":"5008c8c9254e8c9edbcf205e20752ec4","permalink":"https://chankamyung.github.io/publication/2016-asiacrypt-2/","publishdate":"2016-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2016-asiacrypt-2/","section":"publication","summary":"The indistinguishability security of a public-key cryptosystem can be reduced to a computational hard assumption in the random oracle model, where the solution to a computational hard problem is hidden in one of the adversary’s queries to the random oracle. Usually, there is a *finding loss* in finding the correct solution from the query set, especially when the decisional variant of the computational problem is also hard. The problem of finding loss must be addressed towards tight(er) reductions under this type. In EUROCRYPT 2008, Cash, Kiltz and Shoup proposed a novel approach using a trapdoor test that can solve the finding loss problem. The simulator can find the correct solution with overwhelming probability $1$, if there exists a trapdoor test for the adopted hard problem. The proposed approach is efficient and can be used for many Diffie-Hellman computational assumptions. The only limitation is the requirement of a trapdoor test that must be found for the adopted computational assumptions.In this paper, we introduce a universal approach for finding loss, namely *Iterated Random Oracle*, which can be applied to all computational assumptions. The *finding loss* in our proposed approach is very small. For $2^{60}$ queries to the random oracle, the success probability of finding the correct solution from the query set will be as large as $1/64$ compared to $1/2^{60}$ by a random pick. We show how to apply the iterated random oracle for security transformation from key encapsulation mechanism with one-way security to normal encryption with indistinguishability security. The security reduction is very tight due to a small finding loss. The transformation does not expand the ciphertext size. We also give the application of the iterated random oracle in the key exchange.","tags":["Provable-Security Cryptography"],"title":"Iterated Random Oracle: A Universal Approach for Finding Loss in Security Reduction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rongmao Chen","Yi Mu","Guomin Yang","Willy Susilo","Fuchun Guo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1478044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1478044800,"objectID":"cbf29c893be75d96afb4f7ac86b3cb92","permalink":"https://chankamyung.github.io/publication/2017-dcc/","publishdate":"2016-11-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-dcc/","section":"publication","summary":"Leakage attacks, including various kinds of side-channel attacks, allow an attacker to learn partial information about the internal secrets such as the secret key and the randomness of a cryptographic system.

When the number of users increases, the communication, storage, and computational overheads will be increased, and the quality of services such as searching and data sharing for clients could be affected. In order to solve these problems, we formalize an ID-based multi-user searchable encryption (IDB-MUSE) and formally define its security model, where the security notions accommodate indistinguishability against insider’s keyword guessing attack, indistinguishability against chosen keyword attack, and indistinguishability against insider’s identity guessing attack.We present an IDB-MUSE scheme, where the index and search trapdoor are of constant size.We formally prove its security properties. To improve the search efficiency, we divide the computation of the trapdoor into two phases, that is, the offline phase and the online phase. The computation cost for the online phase trapdoor remains constant with respect to the number of users. Based on the IDB-MUSE scheme, a privacy-preserving data search and sharing protocol is proposed, where only the authorized user can access the shared group data. It captures the properties of source authenticity, data and search pattern privacy-preserving, anonymity, and request unlinkability.
